## Fixed

### Ecommerce Product Endpoint Error Handling
- Fixed `/api/ecommerce/product` endpoint throwing 404 error when no products found
- Root cause: API was treating empty product list as error condition instead of valid response
- Solution: Return empty array instead of throwing 404 error when no products exist
- Enhanced error logging with detailed database query information and stack traces
- Added database connectivity checks with product count logging
- Files modified: `backend/src/api/(ext)/ecommerce/product/index.get.ts`

### Ecommerce API Endpoints Implementation
- Created comprehensive order tracking API with timeline generation and shipping status
- Implemented secure digital product download system with expiration and license keys
- Added discount validation API supporting percentage, fixed amount, and free shipping
- Created category-specific product listing endpoint with ratings and reviews
