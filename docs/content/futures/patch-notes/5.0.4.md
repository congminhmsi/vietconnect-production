## Fixed

### **CRITICAL FIXES** - Trading System
- **Futures Markets Display**: Fixed futures markets not showing in the /trade markets panel. The market service was expecting a wrapped API response but the futures market endpoint returns data directly, causing markets to not display properly.
- **Futures Market UI**: Enhanced futures market display with improved leverage parsing, better funding rate formatting, and proper handling of missing data. Leverage now correctly parses string formats like "1,20,50,125" and displays the maximum available leverage.
- **Market Data Presentation**: Improved futures market item display with better visual indicators, enhanced funding rate highlighting, and cleaner data presentation when market data is unavailable.
- **Empty Market Data Handling**: Fixed chart errors when markets return empty data arrays. Added comprehensive safety checks to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors and gracefully handle markets with no trading data.
- **Chart Data Validation**: Enhanced chart data processing with robust validation for invalid or malformed data, preventing crashes when WebSocket streams contain unexpected data formats.
- **OHLCV WebSocket Error Prevention**: Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startsWith')" error in chart WebSocket data processing by adding comprehensive validation for stream data structure and content.
- **Empty Chart State Display**: Added proper empty state overlay when no chart data is available, showing user-friendly message instead of blank chart area.
- **TradingView Chart Error Prevention**: Fixed JavaScript errors in TradingView chart component when receiving empty or invalid OHLCV data from WebSocket streams. Added comprehensive validation for all data structures passed to TradingView library.
- **TradingView Data Validation**: Enhanced TradingView chart data processing with robust validation for API responses, WebSocket messages, and individual candle data to prevent crashes when markets have no trading data.
- **TradingView Symbol Formatting**: Improved symbol formatting for TradingView charts to use proper base/quote extraction logic instead of hardcoded currency lists, ensuring compatibility with all trading pairs.
- **TradingView API Integration Fix**: Fixed TradingView chart data fetching by switching from native fetch to $fetch to match v4 working pattern. Resolved "Not Found" JSON parsing errors that were causing chart initialization failures.
- **TradingView Data Processing**: Simplified TradingView data processing to match proven v4 implementation, removing over-validation that was causing compatibility issues with the TradingView library.
- **TradingView Callback Protection**: Added comprehensive error handling for all TradingView library callbacks (onReady, resolveSymbol, getBars, onRealtimeCallback, onChartReady) to prevent library errors from propagating to the application.
- **TradingView Error Handling**: Enhanced TradingView chart error handling to return empty data instead of throwing errors when API calls fail, preventing chart initialization failures.
- **API Error Response Handling**: Improved API error handling to gracefully process 404 "Not Found" responses without JSON parsing errors, ensuring chart components remain functional even when data is unavailable.
- **Symbol Format Validation**: Removed unnecessary symbol format validation warnings that were causing console spam, as symbol formatting is properly handled by the API formatting functions.
- **Futures Ticker WebSocket**: Fixed futures markets not updating with real-time ticker data by enhancing WebSocket message handling to support both bulk and individual ticker message formats.
- **Futures Market Updates**: Enhanced futures ticker WebSocket to properly process individual ticker messages and update market data in real-time, ensuring futures markets display live price changes like spot markets.
- **Futures Ticker WebSocket Enhancement**: Added dual WebSocket connection system for futures markets - connecting to both bulk ticker endpoint (`/api/futures/ticker`) and individual ticker endpoint (`/api/futures/market`) to ensure all futures markets receive real-time updates regardless of whether they're the active market or not.
- **Futures Ticker Data Fix**: Fixed futures ticker API returning empty data and undefined symbols by correcting the matching engine to include all markets (not just those with trading activity) and properly construct symbols from currency/pair combinations (e.g., MASH + USDT = MASHUSDT).
- **Orderbook Subscription Fix**: Fixed orderbook WebSocket subscription/unsubscription loop by stabilizing callback dependencies and removing unnecessary resubscriptions on aggregation level changes.
- **Empty Orderbook State**: Added proper empty state display for orderbook when no bids or asks are available, showing user-friendly message instead of loading spinner.
- **Chart Animation Infinite Loop Fix**: Fixed critical infinite loop in chart animation system by stabilizing useEffect dependencies, preventing constant re-rendering and improving chart performance significantly.
- **Symbol Format Standardization**: Standardized all market symbols to use `currency/pair` format (e.g., `BTC/USDT`) across all WebSocket endpoints, API endpoints, and frontend components for both spot and futures markets. Updated market APIs, ticker services, chart components, and trading interfaces to ensure consistent symbol handling throughout the application.
