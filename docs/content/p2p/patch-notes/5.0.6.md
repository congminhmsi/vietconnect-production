## Fixed

### **CRITICAL FIXES** - Translation System
- **Dollar Sign Display Issue**: Fixed incorrect "/" character appearing before dollar amounts in P2P interface
  - **Root Cause**: Translation system was incorrectly translating "$" symbol to "/ $" in certain locales
  - **Amount Price Step**: Fixed Total Value display showing "/ $0.00" instead of "$0.00"
  - **Market Price Display**: Corrected current market price showing "/ $" prefix
  - **Calculated Price**: Fixed margin trading calculated price display
  - **Solution**: Removed translation calls for currency symbols, using direct "$" character
  - **Affected Locales**: Fixed issue in multiple language files (am.json, fi.json, fj.json, ja.json, ml.json, lv.json)

- **Step Counter Spacing**: Fixed missing spaces in guided trading step counter
  - **Issue**: Step counter showed "Step4of9" instead of "Step 4 of 9"
  - **Solution**: Added proper spacing between translation keys in trading wizard
  - **Impact**: Improved readability of step progression indicator

- **Amount Label Spacing**: Fixed missing space in amount input label
  - **Issue**: Amount label showed "Amount(BTC)" without proper spacing
  - **Solution**: Added space before crypto symbol in amount label
  - **Impact**: Better visual formatting and readability

- **Payment Methods Spacing**: Fixed multiple spacing issues in payment methods step
  - **Summary Text**: Fixed "1methodselected" to show "1 method selected" 
  - **Processing Time**: Added proper formatting for processing time display
  - **Loading States**: Improved "Creating..." and "Deleting..." text formatting
  - **Impact**: Enhanced readability throughout payment methods interface

- **Trade Terms Validation**: Fixed critical validation issue allowing users to continue with empty required fields
  - **Issue**: Users could proceed to next step without filling mandatory trade terms
  - **Solution**: Improved step completion validation to require trade terms before allowing continuation
  - **Impact**: Ensures all required information is provided before offer creation

- **Processing Time Display**: Fixed double colon formatting issue in payment methods
  - **Issue**: Processing time showed "Processing:: 2" instead of "Processing: 2"
  - **Root Cause**: API data already contained colon prefix, causing duplication when adding another colon
  - **Solution**: Added smart colon handling to detect existing colons and format accordingly
  - **Impact**: Clean, consistent formatting across all payment method displays

- **Review Step Spacing**: Fixed missing spaces in review step section headers
  - **Issue**: Review step displayed "amount_&_pricing", "auto_cancel", "terms_of_trade" without proper spacing
  - **Solution**: Updated translation keys to use proper display text with spaces
  - **Impact**: Clean "Amount & Pricing", "Auto Cancel", "Terms of Trade" display in review step

- **API Payload Validation**: Fixed critical API submission error preventing offer creation
  - **Issue**: Backend expected `paymentMethodIds` array but frontend was sending `paymentMethods` object array
  - **Error**: "Payment Method Ids is required" validation error blocking all offer creation attempts
  - **Solution**: Modified payload transformation to extract payment method IDs from objects array
  - **Impact**: Successful offer creation with proper payment method association

- **Button Loading State**: Implemented proper loading state management for offer creation
  - **Issue**: Users could click "Complete" button multiple times during API submission
  - **Risk**: Potential duplicate offer creation and poor user experience
  - **Solution**: Added loading state with spinner animation and disabled all navigation buttons during submission
  - **Features**: Animated spinner, "Creating..." text, disabled back/cancel buttons during processing
  - **Impact**: Prevents duplicate submissions and provides clear feedback to users

- **Offer Hero Dark Mode**: Fixed offer details hero section to follow zinc-only dark mode design standards
  - **Issue**: Blue background and components not following repository's zinc-only dark mode rule
  - **Components Fixed**: Main hero background, back/edit buttons, crypto icon container, status badges, stats cards
  - **Color Strategy**: Replaced blue backgrounds with zinc-based colors in dark mode while maintaining primary colors in light mode

  - **Impact**: Proper visual consistency with platform design standards in dark mode

- **Trade Form Status Alert**: Fixed owner status notification in trade form for proper dark mode appearance
  - **Issue**: Blue status notification background not following zinc-only dark mode design rule
  - **Components Fixed**: Status notification background, icon colors, text colors
  - **Solution**: Added zinc-based background and border colors for dark mode while preserving blue semantic colors for text
  - **Impact**: Consistent dark mode appearance in trade form owner status notifications

- **P2P Guided Matching Backend Fix**: Fixed critical ORM association alias mismatch causing guided matching failures
  - **Issue**: Backend using incorrect alias "receivedReviews" instead of "p2pReviews" for user review associations
  - **Error**: "Cannot read properties of undefined" when accessing user reviews in guided matching
  - **Root Cause**: Mismatch between user model association alias and guided matching query alias
  - **Solution**: Updated guided matching endpoint to use correct "p2pReviews" alias with proper filtering
  - **Enhancement**: Added WHERE clause to filter reviews by revieweeId for accurate rating calculations
  - **Impact**: Guided matching now works correctly with proper user rating calculations
