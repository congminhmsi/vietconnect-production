# Affiliate v5.0.6
**Release Date:** August 3, 2025  
**Tags:** SECURITY, VALIDATION, PERFORMANCE

## Enhanced

### Commission Percentage Validation
- **Total Commission Limits**: Added validation to prevent total commission percentages from exceeding 100%
  - Binary system commission validation with detailed error messages
  - Unilevel system commission validation with percentage tracking
  - Automatic calculation of total commission across all levels
  - Prevents financial risk from excessive commission configurations

### JSON Parsing Security & Performance
- **Advanced Schema Validation**: Implemented comprehensive JSON schema validation for MLM settings
  - Enhanced malicious content detection with extended pattern matching
  - Structured validation for binary and unilevel configuration schemas
  - Type checking for levels (2-7 range) and percentage arrays
  - Individual level percentage validation (0-100% range)

- **Optimized Parsing Function**: Created centralized `validateAndParseMLMSettings` function
  - Consolidated parsing logic with improved error handling
  - Reduced code duplication across binary and unilevel processors
  - Enhanced security with prototype validation and type checking
  - Better error messages with specific context and troubleshooting information

### Security Improvements
- **Extended Malicious Pattern Detection**: Enhanced protection against JSON injection attacks
  - Added detection for `eval`, `function`, and `require` patterns
  - Comprehensive validation of object prototypes and types
  - Improved error reporting with specific security violation details
  - Size-based validation with configurable limits per settings type

- **Schema-Specific Validation**: Implemented dedicated validation functions for each MLM type
  - `validateBinarySchema()`: Validates binary tree settings structure
  - `validateUnilevelSchema()`: Validates hierarchical settings structure
  - Range validation for levels and percentages
  - Array structure validation for level percentage configurations

## Technical Improvements

### Error Handling Enhancement
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Improved error reporting with specific validation context
  - Commission percentage errors show actual vs allowed values
  - JSON parsing errors include specific pattern violations
  - Schema validation errors provide clear remediation guidance
  - Performance-optimized error logging with structured data

### Code Quality
- **Function Consolidation**: Reduced code complexity through shared validation utilities
  - Eliminated duplicate JSON parsing logic across functions
  - Centralized security validation in reusable functions
  - Improved maintainability with single-responsibility functions
  - Enhanced testing capabilities through modular design

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient Validation**: Optimized validation processes for better performance
  - Early validation termination on first security violation
  - Streamlined commission percentage calculation
  - Reduced memory allocation during JSON processing
  - Improved error handling overhead

## Security Features

### Financial Protection
- Commission overflow prevention with mathematical precision
- Real-time validation during MLM configuration updates
- Audit trail for commission percentage modifications
- Administrative alerts for invalid configuration attempts

### Data Integrity
- Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- Protection against prototype pollution attacks
- Safe JSON parsing with malicious content detection
